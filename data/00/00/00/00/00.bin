  |   Known Issues                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * An issue with Magna Defender's wall bounce OTG state, causing him   |
  |     to receive an incorrect hit reaction from certain OTG attacks. To   |
  |     be fixed in a future patch                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Certain projectile limitations can be bypassed with specific        |
  |     inputs. To be fixed in a future patch                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bug Fixes                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Throws are no longer breakable if the victim is being thrown        |
  |     during an attack, stagger, or crumple state                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Megazord attacks summoned while enemy is KO'd now correctly         |
  |     position themselves                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Block damage KO's on most Special, EX, and Super attacks fixed      |
  |     (all block damage should be able to KO)                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Assists no longer count toward the hit reaction limiter. E.g.,      |
  |     launching an assist no longer counts toward the 2 max launcher      |
  |     limit                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Assists no longer apply pushback while they're being hit in the     |
  |     corner. I.e., "Happy Birthdays" (two-for-one sales) and "Merry      |
  |     Christmases" (comboing the entire enemy team) near the corner       |
  |     should no longer cause massive push back against the attacker       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed various button input issues: holding attack buttons while     |
  |     tapping directions should no longer trigger Special and unique      |
  |     attacks. Tapping back + light + medium on the same frame now        |
  |     executes a back dash instead of a forward dash                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue with throws not properly interacting with armor      |
  |     moves. I.e., throw hitboxes will always grab armored attacks like   |
  |     Dragon Armor Trini's standing heavy and Magna Defender's back       |
  |     medium attack (if timed properly, of course)                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Beam projectiles are no longer reflectable. Dragon Armor Trini's    |
  |     neutral Special can no longer be reflected by Shadow Ranger's       |
  |     forward Special parry attack, for instance                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Most normal attack sound effects no longer linger when played on    |
  |     the first frame of their attack, reducing the amount of phantom     |
  |     sounds (when plink dashing, for example)                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   System-Wide                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * All characters now have non-Super attacks with OTG properties,      |
  |     opening up even more combo routes. I.e., specific attacks for       |
  |     each character can now pick up enemies off of the ground after      |
  |     certain hard knockdowns                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Super armor visual and sound effects improved. Super armor now      |
  |     triggers a distinct sound with a distinct character shader          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Hitstun deterioration for ground-based hitstun is now slightly      |
  |     more aggressive, mitigating certain ground-based loop combos        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Megazord Ultras                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Mega Goldar's light attack (triple stab) now juggles a bit more     |
  |     consistently, and now has OTG properties                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Dragonzord's heavy attack (tail swing) now has OTG properties       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Dino Megazord's medium attack (stomp and punt): stomp portion now   |
  |     has OTG properties and the kick portion now has a much bigger       |
  |     hitbox                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Delta Squad Megazord's light attack (judgment) effect applies       |
  |     much earlier. Cooldown reduced slightly                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Delta Squad Megazord's medium attack lockdown effects (air block    |
  |     disable and jump disable) duration increased by 50%. Startup        |
  |     reduced slightly, with recovery being increased, making it less     |
  |     "spammable", but more impactful                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Delta Squad Megazord's heavy attack startup and cooldown            |
  |     increased slightly                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
